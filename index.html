        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I am a Web Development student from Phoenix Arizona, with experience in CSS, HTML and Javascript, hoping to one day transition into software more generally. </p><p>Ever since I recently drove through the streets of Seattle for a few hours while I was waiting for a flight, my short term career goal has been to complete my program, get a job in Seattle, and then move there permanently. I probably lived there in a past life, in the 80s or something.</p><p>Other than Web Development, my other interests include Film Directing, Film Writing, Film Producing, and Game Development.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Development experience</h3>
        <p>I program every day, between working on school assignments and personal side projects.</p><p>I look forward to meeting and collaborating with like minded people, with whom I can help build something worthwhile and polished. This is probably what I most look forward to in entering this industry, is the connections I'll form and the things they will allow me to do which I wouldn't be able to do alone.</p>

    <section class="item">

        <h3>Services I provide</h3>
        <p>This is where I will list things I can do (once I know how to do them and what they're called, because at the moment I know neither).</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>My Skills and Specialties</h3>
        <p>This is where I will list my skills and what I have experience with. I'll make it a seperate card if it get's too big (which is kind of the point, I believe).</p>
