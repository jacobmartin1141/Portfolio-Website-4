      <h3>About me:</h3>
      <div>
        <p>I am a Web Development student from Phoenix Arizona, with experience in CSS, HTML and Javascript, hoping to one day transition into software more generally. </p><p>Ever since I recently drove through the streets of Seattle for a few hours while I was waiting for a flight, my short term career goal has been to complete my program, get a job in Seattle, and then move there permanently. I probably lived there in a past life, in the 80s or something.</p><p>Other than Web Development, my other interests include Film Directing, Film Writing, Film Producing, and Game Development.</p>
